    <p>Hi, I'm Priya and I am currently learning about web development on the Leeds Reboot Course.</p>

    <h4>Introduction to Web Development</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p> I learnt how to fork a repository on github, then clone it to my computer.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>I followed along with the instructor in real time. </p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I had some trouble at first cloning the copy from github to my computer, as I forgot which file I saved it to. </p>
    <p>I solved this issue by making sure I cloned it to a location such as my desktop, so it was much easier to find.</p>

    <h4>Github</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I learnt how to create a new repository with branches. I then learnt how to delete the branch.</p>
    <p>I also learnt how to create an index html and use Emmet shortcuts. I created some heading tags and paragraph tags too.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>I followed along with the instructor in real time and then afterwards I repeated the process by myself.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>When trying it out by myself I found it hard to remember the whole process, but through trial and error I was able to create a new repository with a branch, and a index html file with some heading and paragraph tags. </p>
